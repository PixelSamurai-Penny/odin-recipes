    <p>Here is a lemon cupcake recipe I use for beautifully delicious treats.        
       These cupcakes are truly lighter than air, will melt in your mouth and very easy to make.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>

       <li>3 cups self-rising flour</li>
       <li> ½ teaspoon salt </li>
       <li>1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
       <li>2 cups white sugar </li>
       <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons lemon zest  </li>
       <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
       <li>1 cup whole milk, divided</li>
       <li>2 ½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice, divided</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
       
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 30 cupcake pan cups with paper liners. </li>

        <li> Prepare the cupcakes: Sift flour and salt together in a bowl. Beat butter and sugar together in another bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add in eggs one at a time, beating after each addition to incorporate. 
            Mix in lemon zest and vanilla.</li>
     
        <li>Gently beat flour mixture into butter mixture, 1/3 at a time, alternating with 1/2 of the milk and 1/2 of the lemon juice after each of the first two additions of flour. Beat until just combined; do not overmix.</li>  
        
        <li>Fill the prepared cupcake liners with batter, 3/4 full, and bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 17 minutes. 
            Let the cupcakes cool in the pans before removing them to finish cooling on a rack, about 10 minutes. </li>

    </ol>
