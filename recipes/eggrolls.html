        <li> black pepper to taste </li>
            
        <li>2 tbsp cornstarch, divided </li>
            
        <li> 4 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed </li>
            
        <li> 2 tbsp cold water </li>
            
        <li>20 egg roll wrappers </li>

    </ul>

     <h2>Steps</h2>

     <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add egg and cook, without stirring, until the bottom has set. 
            Flip and cook until set on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and finely chop.   </li>

      

        <li>Mix cabbage, bean sprouts, carrot, celery, and onion together in a large bowl. Stir in shrimp, soy sauce, garlic powder, and pepper.
             Stir in chopped egg, then sprinkle 1 tablespoon cornstarch over top. Mix to combine and let sit for 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Heat 3 to 4 inches vegetable oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix water and remaining 1 tablespoon cornstarch together in a small bowl.</li>     

        <li>Place an egg roll wrapper onto a work surface with one corner pointing away from you like a diamond. 
            Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons shrimp mixture into the center. Moisten the top and side corners with the wet cornstarch mixture. 
            Fold the dry bottom corner up and over the filling, making a tight tube. Fold the side corners in, pressing to stick against the folded roll, then roll toward the top corner to complete. 
            Repeat to make remaining egg rolls. </li>

        <li>Working in batches, carefully fry egg rolls in the preheated fryer until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels. </li>
